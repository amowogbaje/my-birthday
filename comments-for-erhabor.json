This wasn't just a choice of affiliation; it was an opening to your wisdom and guidance, which has profoundly shaped me. \n\nThe growth I've experienced across all facets of my life since then is a direct testament to your influence. Even now, settled in the UK since 2022, your messages remain a foundational pillar in my daily application of faith and life principles. Though I'm still striving towards my ultimate goals, the journey thus far has been one of remarkable transformation, all thanks to your teaching and unwavering prayers.\n\nOn this special day, my wife Ajibike, our daughter Ooreofe, and our son Obafemi join me in extending our warmest birthday wishes, sir.
